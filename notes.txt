Timing Information:
-------------------

Extra Large Array
-----------------
Time to run code with push(): 2.829401 ms
Time to run code with unshift(): 728.441719 ms

Large Array
-----------
Time to run code with push(): 141 microseconds 148 nanoseconds
Time to run code with unshift(): 5 milliseconds 264 microseconds 546 nanoseconds

Medium Array
------------
Time to run code with push(): 77 microseconds 902 nanoseconds
Time to run code with unshift(): 88 microseconds 820 nanoseconds

Small Array
-----------
Time to run code with push(): 4 microseconds 783 nanoseconds
Time to run code with unshift(): 6 microseconds 296 nanoseconds

Tiny Array
----------
Time to run code with push(): 4 microseconds 926 nanoseconds
Time to run code with unshift(): 6 microseconds 866 nanoseconds

Note:
Microsecond is one millionth of a second. Millisecond is one thousandth of a second.

Pattern:
For tinym small, and medium arrays, the run time using push() and unshift() are not largely diffrent
But for large and extra large arrays, the run time using push() and unshift() are largely different

Scale:
push() function is better for scaling than unshift() function
push() function runs in constant time O(1) while unshift() runs in linear time O(n)

Why push() has better runtime than unshift()?
Because push adds new elements to the end of the array and rarely needs to reallocate memory and copy data over
whereas unshift adds new elements to the beginning of the array and always needs to reallocate memory and copy data over
